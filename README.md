**SoundIO** (**Sound** **I**nput/**O**utput) is a header-only, cross-platform, high-level audio library for C++ built on top of miniaudio.

It gives you a **node-based** audio graph abstraction so you can connect audio inputs, outputs, files and manage playback without worrying about low-level device handling, memory safety, or backend quirks for those who want to work with audio quickly and easily.

Works anywhere miniaudio works - from desktop to mobile to the web;

***Because simple audio shouldn't be such a headache.***

# Demo

Not yet :v

# Features

- **Header-only**, modern `C++17+`, no extra library required
- **Extremely simple API**, node-based graph, subscription based calls
- **Low memory footprint and low overhead**, simply wrapping miniaudio
- **Format negociation built-in**, no need to resample or convert between inputs and outputs
- **Supports for input and output devices**, microphones and speakers, for all platforms are built in, with ability to fetch them with a normalized id for all platforms
- **File playback and recording**, (WAV, MP3, OGG, PCM) - support for the following formats are out of the box
- **Mixing, combining, resampling, playback**, built-in for complex but easy-to-use audio manipulation
- **Runs anywhere miniaudio runs**: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Web _(see supported backends below)_

### Remaining features
<details> <summary>Click to see the remaining features...</summary>

#### File Features
* `AudioFileOutput.h` - Exports file data

### Mixing Features
* `AudioMixer.h` - Base class for mixing PCM audio
* `AudioCombiner.h` - Combines multiple inputs into a single mixed output
* `AudioResampler.h` - Resamples an input into 

### Playback
* `AudioPlayer.h` - Manages the playback of an input into the output

### Other

Shutting down, finishing the SoundIO.h class, cleaning up code, documenting methods,
QA + Testing and example scripts should be written.

*__TL;DR:__ if its supported by miniaudio.h, it is supported by SoundIO.*

# Installation

# Usage

To use SoundIO, simply include the header file.
```cpp
#include <SoundIO.h>
```

Initialize and shutting down SoundIO:
```cpp
// storing result is optional.
ma_result result = SoundIO::initialize();

// shutting down (when done to clean up)
ma_result result = SoundIO::shutdown();
```

> [!WARNING]
> To create SoundIO instances, it is **required** that you use `SoundIO::create*` because their memory management will be handled by SoundIO.

Playing a file

```cpp
// get default speaker
auto* speaker = SoundIO::getDefaultSpeaker();

// create a file input, and open the file
auto* file = SoundIO::createFileInput();
ma_result result = file->open("sample.mp3");

// if the file was successfully loaded
if (result == MA_SUCCESS) 
    // the output of the file will be drained to the speaker.
    file->subscribe(speaker);

```

Playing a file with playback
```cpp

```

Listing devices and getting their information
```cpp
// by default, when getDefaultSpeaker or Microphone have an argument called autoWake defaulting to true that wakes up devices.
// in order to avoid wasting resources, only wake up the devices using ensureAwake and sleep when you do not need them anymore.

```

Simple microphone to speaker loopback
```cpp
// get default microphone and speaker
auto* microphone = SoundIO::getDefaultMicrophone();
auto* speaker = SoundIO::getDefaultSpeaker();

// initialize loopback.
// resampling and format negociation is automatically handled by SoundIO.
microphone->subscribe(speaker);
```

Recording microphone data to a file
```cpp
// get default microphone
auto* microphone = SoundIO::getDefaultMicrophone();

// create a file input, and open the file
// format IS required (mp3, wav, pcm etc)
// for the sake of simplicity, we take the mic's default PCM format (.pcm).
auto* file = SoundIO::createFileOutput();
ma_result result = file->open("recording.pcm", mic->deviceFormat);

// if the file was successfully loaded
if (result == MA_SUCCESS) 
    // the output of the microphone will be saved to the file automatically.
    microphone->subscribe(file);
```
